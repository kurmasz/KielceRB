* When loading and rendering, the same context object is used by default.  
  That means that instance variables and methods set in one kielce_data file
  are available in other files as well as when rendering erb.
  However, a new binding is requested during each method call, so 
  local variables set during one load/render are not available for 
  subsequent loads/renders
