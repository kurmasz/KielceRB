* Make gemspec description longer

* Is there a test for "no such key" when error is in a function instead of directly in erb?

* Add system to verify that "KielceData" directories get read.

* Move all code into one file.  Run using “Kielce d”, “Kielce t”, etc.  (Can make short-cuts using aliases)

* Move config info into a file co-located with the executable (default target, semester boundaries, etc.)

* Perhaps that config file should be in Kielce format itself???

* Make sure deploys can be done from different directories

* When does change to assignment necessitate change to main web page?

* Easy way to copy all static files to staging (everything except --- perhaps done with rsync)

* What was the purpose of kielce_module?

* When rendering the ERB template, should we send the data to a special object and use that context?

* When there is an error in KielceData try to print a line number.

* Nested includes should work relative to the included file (or we need render relative)

* What should we do with errors in nested render?

# TODO Consider using e.backtrace_locations instead of @file_stack
# (Question: What exaclty do you want to see if render_relative is called
# by a method)

=============

Documentation:

* Change file pattern for data files (default is kielce_data*.rb): QZ001

* Objects created inside lambdas are in a different scope than methods created in the kielce_data files outside of the hashes.
